# InformationSystems_TermProject
Term project for the course 'Analysis and Design of Information Systems', NTUA, 2023/24

## Objective:
This project was carried out as the chosen term project for the course of "Analysis and Design of Information Systems" at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens. The objective is a comparative study of QuestDB and CrateDB, two Time-Series DBs - databases oriented and adapted for managing time-series data -, and includes the installation and setup of the system, that will host the two databases, and of the databases themselves, the data generation and insertion into the two DBs and the query generation and execution. With a view to compare the databases suitable performance measurements were carried, and namely data insertion and query execution time, thoughput, latency, cpu usage and node/cluster load (cluster load only for CrateDB, the only distributed DB amongst the two).
